                    </div> 
                    I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at <a href="https://luddy.indiana.edu/"> Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering</a>, Indiana University Bloomington. Additionally, I serve as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://privacy.luddy.indiana.edu/"> IU Privacy Lab</a>, advised by Professor Apu Kapadia. I'm conducting doctoral research in the area of conversational agents and decision-making. 
                    
                    My doctoral research explores how we can use linguistic and vocal interventions to help users make better decisions within those interactions. My expertise includes <strong> developing conversational AI prototypes, experimental study design, statistical and qualitative analysis, applied machine learning and LLM fine-tuning </strong>. I have also developed an user friendly <strong>eXplainable AI (XAI)</strong> interface during my internship at <a href="https://inl.gov/">Idaho National Laboratory</a> in summer 2023. Currently, I am leading multiple projects utilizing the nuances of LLM-powered conversational agents to improve teenagers' and social media users' decision-making. Moreover, I have a profound interest in utilizing LLM fine-tuning and evaluation for trustworthy AI systems design to improve the interaction outcome for users and prevent unwanted manipulation.

			            		<strong>Understand:</strong>
			           				 I begin by reviewing relevant literature, engaging in conversations with field experts, and conducting small-scale formative studies. This helps me get a clear picture of user needs, domain practices, and the significance of the problem. <br/>
			           			<strong>Prototype and Study Design:</strong>
			           				 I design user-centered AI experiences by prototyping interfaces and interaction patterns focused on addressing the specific problem. Lately, I have been placing greater emphasis on developing high-fidelity prototypes to more accurately assess how users engage with AI features. I carefully develop clear research questions and strong study protocols to ensure validity, reduce confounding factors, and support accessibility and inclusivity for the target audience.<br/>
			           			<strong>Evaluate:</strong>
			           				 I evaluate the proposed designs with mixed method studies including lab experiments and online studies. My analysis approaches consist of quantitative measures such as descriptive and inferential analyses and qualitative techniques like thematic analysis. This comprehensive approach helps me understand both how well the proposed design works and identify improvements to better serve a diverse population.<br/>
			           			<strong>Storytelling:</strong>
			           				 I believe that research is only impactful when it has a clean story. I transform my research findings into clear, engaging stories for an interdisciplinary audience. My aim is to highlight the human impact and ethical considerations, making sure my work supports responsible and useful AI.<br/>

The findings suggest that errors in critical situations significantly erode trust, regardless of when they occur, while late-stage errors in less critical contexts have a greater negative impact.</p>

			            <ul>
				            <li> Formulated an Execution Plan for an Explainable AI Project: Devised a comprehensive plan for implementing Explainable AI within a water pump fault prediction software. This included strategically enhancing Explainable AI techniques to improve the interpretability of machine learning predictions.</li>
				            <li>Collaborated on Interface Design with the Human Factor Team: Worked closely with the human factor team to create questionnaires for experts and operators. The goal was to uncover their requirements for interface design, ensuring clarity in understanding machine learning prediction outcomes.</li>
				            <li>Facilitated Iterative Development of Explainable AI Interface: Through multiple planning and development cycles, incorporating feedback from mentors, I successfully crafted an efficient Explainable AI interface for the water pump fault prediction software with LIME and SHAP. This interface not only enhanced the interpretability of machine learning outcomes but also empowered operators to make well-informed decisions.</li>
				            <li>Presented a poster at the intern poster session <a href="https://internpostersession.inl.gov/InternPosters2023/inl_poster_sabid_Sabid%20Bin%20Habib%20Pias.JPG">[Poster]</a></li>
